career-profile:
    title: Cover Letter
    summary: |
      I first met the <b>"Artificial Intelligence"</b> during my freshman year of college.
      I've been selected as a Computer Media department (similar to a general Computer Science),
        and have learned about <b>Software Development</b>,
        while the interest in AI has been steadily continuing.
      At that time, I didn't know about Deep Learning stuffs,
        but I wondered how Neuroscience is reflected in AI,
        so I studied <b>Neuroscience</b> on my own.

      I wanted to study more about Neuroscience and apply it to AI,
        so I entered the graduate school of <b>Brain and Cognitive Sciences</b> and
          learn how to take structural/functioanl MRI and analyze the data,
        and learned the human brain in many ways.

      At a time of heightened public interest in Deep Learning,
        I received a master's degree.
      And I thought, now I have to do some AI things, and I've jumped into the career.

      My first job was ScatterLab.
      My main task was to create chatbots with <b>Natural Language Processing</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b> techniques.
      I learned a lot of things through my work for two years,
        but I felt the limitation of industry and want to study more in academia.

      My second and current job is IBS-CNIR.
      Now I'm doing functional MRI data analysis in motor learning,
        and I'm more familiar with <b>Multivariate Pattern Analysis</b> techniques, computational modeling, and statistics.

      I am now looking for the next step.
      Where research of AI allows us to study human cognition more deeply,
        or where research of human brain send us further advanced AI,
        so, I want to go a place where I can achieve my belief that people and machines can complement each other.
