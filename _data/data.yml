    title: Cover Letter (for general)
    summary: |
      I first met the "Artificial Intelligence" during my freshman year of college. 
      I've been selected as a Computer Media department (similar to a general Computer Science), 
        and have learned about software development, 
        while the interest in AI has been steadily continuing.
      At the time, I didn't know about Deep Learning things, 
        but I wondered how Neuroscience is reflected in AI,
        so I studied Neuroscience on my own.
      
      I wanted to study more about Neuroscience and apply to it AI, 
        so I entered the graduate school and 
          learn how to take structural/functioanl MRI and analyze the data, 
        and learned the human brain in many ways.
      
      At a time of heightened public interest in Deep Learning, 
        I received a master's degree.
      And I thought, now I have to do some AI things, and I've jumped into the career.
      
      My first job was ScatterLab. 
      My main task was to create chatbots with Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.
      I learned a lot of things through my work for two years, 
        but I felt the limitation of technology and want to study more in academia.
      
      My second and current job is IBS-CNIR.
      Now I'm doing functional MRI data analysis in motor learning,
        and I'm a little more familiar with Multivariate Pattern Analysis techniques, computational modeling, and statistics.
        
      I am now looking for the next step.
      Where research of AI allows us to study human cognition more deeply,
        or where research of human brain send us further advanced AI, 
        so, I want to go a place where I can achieve my belief that people and machines can complement each other.
